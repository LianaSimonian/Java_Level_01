Create a snake game.

Given an 8x8 matrix filled by 0s, a small point snake located at (0x0) position, and an apple at (2,1).

Every time the program prints the snake board and asks a user to enter a snake movement direction.

The entered w symbol means up, s down, left, and d right.

When the snake eats the apple, its size increases from the tail, and a new apple appears in a random free position.
